        <h2>Infrastructure and Research Areas</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Plant Biology :-</strong> The Institute has state-of-the art lab for carrying out studies in the area of proteomics, genomics and metabolomics. Cutting edge research is being carried out to unravel the genes involved in important biosynthetic pathway in plants for production of secondary metabolites like picroside, shikonin, catechin, stevioside etc. Several stress related genes have been isolated, cloned and their expression analyses are underway in target plants. Studies are being carried out in the area of gene silencing, epigenetics, understanding signaling and deciphering mechanism of plant adaptation under stress and changing environment.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Nanotechnology :-</strong> Studies have been initiated in the area of nanobiology with infrastructure being strengthened by installing multimode scanning probe microscope, transmission electron microscope, Atomic force microscope etc. The focus is to develop nanocatalysts, multimodal imaging systems for diagnostics and increasing bioavailability of existing drugs.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Bioinformatics :-</strong> he bioinformatics facility is equipped with range of high end servers, work stations, etc. It has access to the next generation sequencing facility, Illumina Genome Analyzer II, through a Linux cluster with 10 TB disk space and 140 GB physical memory. The focus is to develop novel algorithms and tools for analysis of large and complex plant genomes.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Microbiology :-</strong> The microbiology lab is well equipped with different type of high-end microscopes, shakers incubators, bioreactor, FAME analysis etc. Intensive work is underway for bioprospection of microbes, genes and proteins from niche locations particularly from the cold desert area of the Himalayan zone.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Food Processing :-</strong> IHBT has established the food and nutraceutical laboratory equipped with NIR composition analyzer, mixolab, cutting mill, single screw extruder, planetary mixer, deep fryer, vacuum packing machine, lyophilizer, colour index meter and water activity meter to lead functional foods and nutraceuticals research for health and nutrition management.

            </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity  :-</strong> he Bioresource development unit of the Institute has GIS facility, computational facility for inventorization, database development and mapping of plant resources and assessing landscape element types and land use pattern. The unit also maintains and updates the internationally recognized referral herbarium. A fernery has been developed which houses rare and economically important pteridophytes of Himalayan region. Farms and the range of polyhouses support domestication and development of agrotechnology of economically important medicinal and aromatic plants.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Chemical Sciences :-</strong> The Natural Plant Product Unit focuses research on chemical characterization of active constituents from plant sources, essential oil, total synthesis of biologically active compounds, molecular modification for value added compounds, natural colours and dyes. The Regulatory Research Center (RRC) is well equipped with facilities for animal breeding and experimentation. These include animal house to maintain and breed the small animals like Mouse and Rats and maintain the Guinea Pigs and Rabbits. Facility has been registered with central regulatory agency on animal experimentation, CPCSEA, New Delhi. The unit also has well equipped lab for BSL2 cell culture facility. The focus is to conduct toxicological safety evaluation of novel food constituents, cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals of natural origin. in-vitro and in-vivo screening to identify the lead molecules for Antidiabetic, Anti-inflammatory Nephro and hepatoprotective activities. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Tea Sciences :-</strong> Tea is one of the mandate crops of the institute and research is focused on germplasm and chemical characterization, improving processing parameters for flavor enhancement and to develop value added tea products. For promoting organic practices work is underway to develop biopesticides and Bioformulation for plant health management and improving plant productivity. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Floriculture :-</strong> A floriculture field with greenhouse exist to undertake agrotechnological studies of ornamentals under open field and polyhouse conditions. Work is also being carried out to develop hybrids and mutants through conventional and non- conventional breeding programmes. The unit has a cold chamber for storing quality planting materials for further use.</li> <br>

        <h2>Research Achievments/Recognitions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Aromatic Oils From Himalayas :-</strong> The Himalayan region is a rich source of high value aromatic crops. Under Aroma Mission of CSIR, the Institute is working on development of improved varieties, agrotechnology, processing and value addition of Himalayan aromatic crops for improving rural economy of this region. The Institute is promoting extensive cultivation of aromatic crop for doubling the farmer’s income. Through technical advice, distribution of high quality planting materials and training in distillation technology, the Institute is striving to increase the production of high quality essential oils by the farmers to meet the industrial demand. This website will facilitate in cultivation and processing of aromatic crops for boosting the essential oil trade.</li> <br>
            <li><strong> Asafoetida (Heeng) Cultivation :-</strong> Farmers of the remote Lahaul Valley in Himachal Pradesh have started taking up cultivation of asafoetida (hing), mainly due to the efforts of the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, using the vast wasteland in the cold desert conditions of the region.</li> <br>
