        <p>The National Dairy Research Institute is our country’s premier Dairy Research institution. ICAR-NDRI plays a crucial role in developing quality human resource for the dairy sector of the country by developing need based educational programmes and introducing innovations in learning styles and pedagogy. <br> The Institute undertakes basic and applied research, teaching and extension activities helping towards dairy development, animal productivity, development of new products and practices for the benefit of millions of farmers and consumers. Over the 99 years, the Institute has shown remarkable development and expertise in different areas of dairy production, processing, management and human resource development. <br> 
     ICAR NDRI has two regional stations viz. Southern Regional Station at Bangalore and Eastern Regional Station Station at Kalyani to serve the cause of dairying in the southern and eastern states respectively. The University Grants Commission conferred the Institute with Deemed University status in March 1989. Currently, the Institute is rated as an outstanding University and has secured first rank amongst the Agricultural Universities of our country. </p></div>
