        <p>
            Indian Institute of Toxicology Research is a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and
            Industrial Research, Government of India. It is a premier toxicological research organization in Asia and
            was established on 4th November 1965 as Industrial Toxicology Research Center in Lucknow. in 2008, it was
            renamed as CSIR Indian Institute of Toxicology Research. The institute was formally dedicated to the nation
            on 27 July 1976 by the then president of India - his excellency Shri Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. CSIR IITR plays a
            major role in safeguarding the human and environmental health in our country. The mandate of CSIR IITR not
            only includes the study of xenobiotics on human health but also on water, soil and air. The objectives of
            CSIR IITR symbolize our country's commitment towards sustainable industrialization and development.

        <h2>Research Areas</h2>
        <p> More than five decades of experience and excellence in toxicological research has empowered the institute to
            conduct research in contemporary areas. CSIR IITR has carried out extensive toxicity studies on dyes,
            pesticides, heavy metals plastics, polymers, food colors, herbal products and fibers.
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Food, Drug & Chemical Toxicology :-</strong> Food is of paramount importance as it is required
                for leading a healthy life. There has been an increase in concerns regarding contamination of food items
                either through the environmental pollution or adulteration all over the world. The scientists working in
                this group are utilizing state-of-the-art technology and are involved in research endeavors which
                include detection of genetically modified crops and their safety as well as identification of herbal
                preparations which can modify the toxicity of these chemical moieties.
            </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Environmental Toxicology :-</strong> A large variety of chemicals synthetic products and
                engineered nanomaterials are released into the environment every year. The goals of environment
                toxicology groups are to explore cellular genetic and organismal approaches for detection and
                alleviation of various environmental pollutants.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Systems Toxicology & Health Risk Assessment :-</strong> This group attempts to integrate the
                traditional methods of experimental toxicology with high throughput systems, data analysis and modeling
                tools to allow for a more sensitive and early detection of adverse effects for use in risk assessments.
            </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Toxicology :-</strong> Safety of human health and environment is the primary concern
                of the world. The adequacy and quality of safety data allows to take regulatory decisions for
                production, marketing, transport, storage, labeling and the usage of a wide variety of industrial and
                agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products and food additives that have an overriding influence
                on the sustainment and quality of our life and environment. CSIR IITR is the only institute in the CSIR
                family to have an international accreditation in the form of toxicity testing known as GLP or good
                laboratory practices.</li> <br>

        <h2>Achievments and Recognitions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) :-</strong> Good laboratory practice or GLP is a set of
                principles intended to assure the quality and integrity of non-clinical laboratory studies that are
                intended to support research or marketing permits for products regulated by government agencies.
                CSIR-IITR has Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance Certification from NGCMA, Government of India,
                issued with respect to Toxicity studies, Mutagenicity studies, Environmental toxicity studies on aquatic
                & terrestrial organisms, and Analytical & clinical chemistry testing. </li> <br>
