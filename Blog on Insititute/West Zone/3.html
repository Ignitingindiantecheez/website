        <p>Apart from being an indispensable item of food, salt is an important raw material for the manufacture of several heavy chemicals e.g. soda ash, caustic soda and chlorine. Besides, salt is used in food processing industries, such as fish curing, meat packing, dairy products and fruit and vegetable canning. CSIR-CSMCRI with its persistent efforts and continued scientific excitement has achieved technological excellence in the core mandate it pursues and is one among the top performing national R&D laboratories in the country. As on April 2021, the Institute has around 210 staff with 170 S&T staff on its roll and around 200 research fellows and project assistants pursing their doctoral programme and engaged in several projects.</p>

            <li><strong>Membrane Science And Separation Technology Division :-</strong>The rapid growth of population has been the key feature of Indian urbanization. The urban population in India has increased around three-fold during the last six decades, which has escalated the requirement for potable water. According to a report of the Indian Ministry of Water Resources, India has 18% of the world's population with only 4% of the total global usable water resources. Another report reveals that India will move into the category of the water-stressed state by 2050. Considering this scenario, it is essential to promote our activities (research and technology development) for water treatment. Due to the variation in the quality of feed water and contaminants in this country, we have to develop need-based and region-specific technologies. CSIR-CSMCRI has developed several membrane-based technologies using indigenously developed membranes for the water desalination/purification to provide safe drinking water. These technologies were also commercialized and well-tested in the remote rural areas of the country. Polymer electrolyte membranes have found diversified applications in fuel cells, storage battery and other energy devices. <br><br> To read more :- <a href="https://www.csmcri.res.in/research-and-development/Membrane-Science-and-Separation-Technology-Division?team=22" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li> <br>
            <li><strong>Marine Algal Research Station Mandapam  :-</strong> Marine Algal Research Station, Mandapam was established on 01.01.1967 exclusively to develop seaweed cultivation. The centre is ideally located on the Gulf of Mannar coastline where seaweed is abundant. The centre has first developed Gracilaria edulis (agarophyte) cultivation using the rope method in Krusadai island and later developed Gelidiella acerosa (agarophyte) cultivation using the coral stone method in Ervadi coastline. During early 2000, the centre has successively developed Kappaphycus alvarezii cultivation which was licensed to Aquagri P Ltd Delhi for commercial cultivation. K.alvarezii cultivation provides best livelihood for about 1000 fisher population of Tamil Nadu coast.

              The team is actively involving in exploring new seaweeds and new technologies in seaweed cultivation for sustainable commercial seaweed cultivation along the Tamil Nadu coast. The team is currently focusing the research activities on a) Elite Kappaphycus alvarezii seedling production through tissue culture technique b) Commercial seedling production of Gracilaria edulis through spore culture c) cultivation of indigenous carrageenaophytes d) Pilot scale seedling production of Kappaphycus alvarezii and e) Pilot scale cultivation of seaweeds in Andaman coast. <br><br>To read more :- <a href="" target="_blank">Click Here</a></li> <br>
