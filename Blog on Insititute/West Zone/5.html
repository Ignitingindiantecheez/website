      <h2>Centers of Excellence</h2><br>
      <p>During the last few years, CSIR-NCL has initiated five Centres of Excellence to encourage and carry out excellent research in specified areas by bringing in like-minded people together through discussions and to train staff and students in doing quality research using the best infrastructure and facilities.
      
        <ol>
          
          <li><b>Nano-materials & nano-particles :- </b>Nanoscale materials are considered to be attractive building blocks for constructing novel devices due to their unique size-dependent, and often tunable, thermal, optical, electronic and magnetic properties arising from quantum confinement effects. In particular, there has been a great deal of interest in creating ordered assemblies of nanoclusters of select sizes, arranged in specific configurations. Scientists at NCL prepare several such hybrid materials in the form of nanotubes, and nano-composites inorder to reap their benefits in potential applications such as sensors, catalysis, nonlinear optics and single electron devices.</li>  <br>
          <li><b>Micro reactor Engineering :- </b>With NCLâ€™s strengths in synthesis, catalysis, analysis, engineering and direct relevance with the industrial research, a Centre of Excellence on Microreaction Technology (CoE) is a long term program where the advantages of miniaturization and continuous flow are explored and extended towards the understanding science of small devices and further use it to develop new technologies.</li> <br>
          <li><b>Scientific Computing :- </b>The Center of Excellence in Scientific Computing (CoESC) promotes R&D activities in scientific computing in all branches of chemistry, chemical engineering and chemical informational sciences. </li> <br>
          <li><b>Solar Power :- </b>CSIR-NCL is playing a leading role in the area of clean and renewable energy under its TAPSUN program of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Energy Mission. About 15 scientists from various areas are contributing and have already published high impact papers and have several patent disclosures to their credit.</li> <br>
          <li><b>Surface Science :- </b>The center explores and understands the surface science aspects of materials towards various applications and encourages collaborative efforts between surface science and those processes that involves surfaces extensively, such as catalysis and nano-science, to generate cutting-edge scientific findings.</li> <br>
          <li><b>Specialty Polymers for Customized Additive Manufacturing :- </b>The Centre of Excellence in Specialty Polymers for Customized Additive Manufacturing has been established at CSIR-NCL Pune through the support of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC), Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizers, Government of India along with Research, Project Planning & Business Development Directorate, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, New Delhi. Leveraging our unique expertise in synthetic polymer chemistry and material science and engineering, the center strives to be the first-choice connecting point for industry partners in India to develop new polymeric materials and composites suitable for additive manufacturing techniques such as FDM and SLA. We also focus on structure-property relationships in 3D printed products using advanced characterization tools such as electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray microtomography, differential scanning calorimetry and mechanical testing. We also have the capabilities for 3D bioprinting that combine cells, functional biomolecules and biomaterials to mimic natural tissues. With our state-of-the-art research capabilities, excellence in basic science and proven delivery of applied solutions, we aim to advance the field of additive manufacturing in India. The center invites interested industrial partners to actively participate for collaborative research. <br>
