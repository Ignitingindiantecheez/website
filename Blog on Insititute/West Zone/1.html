    <p>Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) are a group of premier public research institutions
      in India. These institutes were established by the Government of India through the Ministry of Human Resource
      Development to promote quality education and research in science and related areas. All IISERs were declared as
      Institutes of National Importance by the Parliament of India in 2012, to promote them as leading institutions in
      the country in the field of basic sciences.
      Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal is an autonomous public university in Bhopal district,
      Madhya Pradesh, India. It was established in 2008 in order to incorporate research in basic science at
      undergraduate and graduate level, with equal emphasis on higher education for research and education in science.
      The prime focus of the Institute is to integrate science education with research.

    <h2>Departments</h2>

    <p>In the natural sciences stream, the institute has the following departments:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Biological Sciences :- </strong> The aim of this department is to foster knowledge in students
        pertaining to basic and advanced areas of biological sciences by not only pursuing both teaching and
        high-quality research but also through integrating biology with physics, chemistry and mathematics.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Chemistry :- </strong> Research groups in this department are dedicated to carrying out cutting edge
        research in basic and applied fields of chemistry
        including materials science, chemical biology, organic and organometallic chemistry, theoretical chemistry,
        spectroscopy and crystallography.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Earth and Environmental Sciences :- </strong> Earth is a dynamic planet whose surface is constantly
        modified by wind, water, earthquakes, volcanoes, and, increasingly,
        human activities. The dedicated faculty of this department are
        engaged in research that is crucial for better understanding
        our planet.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Mathematics :- </strong> It is the constant endeavour
        of the Mathematics Department to conduct fundamental
        research in mathematics, and to train students
        by providing them a broad and solid foundation
        in Mathematics.
        It strives to give a balanced training to
        students, and prepare them for pursuing a
        research career in mathematics, as well as
        for a non-academic employment after graduation.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Physics :- </strong>The Physics department provides students with the opportunity to explore and
        nurture interdisciplinary interests by allowing them to take courses in other disciplines along with physics.
      </li><br>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> In Engineering Sciences stream, the institute offers programmes in:
    <ol>
      <li>Chemical Engineering</li>
      <li>Data Science Engineering</li>
      <li>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Under the Humanities and Social Science Stream,
      one can pursue courses in:

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Economic Sciences :- </strong>The Department of Economic
        Sciences at IISER Bhopal was set up in 2017 with the objective of promoting research and
        training in all areas of Economics. The research interests of the current faculty
        span microeconomics, game theory, trade theory, industrial organisation, public economics,
        social choice theory, corporate finance, option pricing, behavioural economics, agriculture
        economics and environmental economics. </li>
        <li><strong>Humanities and Social Sciences :- </strong>The Humanities
          and Social Sciences (HSS) Department at IISER Bhopal was set up recently with the aim of
          encouraging and inculcating a humanistic approach and awareness among students and researchers of science. It seeks to encourage students to view science holistically as a domain of human knowledge which is not in isolation from, but in productive dialogue with society and culture, and with other areas of human production and thought like creative arts, philosophy and literature. The department has been conceptualised with this vision of foregrounding the interfaces between science, society and culture, and of initiating a dialogue between the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities.
