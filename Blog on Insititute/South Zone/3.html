        <h2>Research Divisions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Agro Processing And Technology Division  :-</strong> Agroprocessing and Technology Division (APTD) is a multidisciplinary centre with main focus on process (shelf life enhancement, storage, value addition) and product development (nutraceuticals, functional foods, dietary supplements, phyto pharmaceuticals, bio-fertilizers & bio pesticides) emphasizing agri produce & plant resources. One of the main objectives of the division is improvement of general welfare of farmers through high returns of their produce via scientific and technological intervention and innovation. Division has major pilot plant facilities and a technology business incubation centre (TBIC) in the area of agro-processing. APTD is also involved in the development and validation of nutraceuticals and phyto pharmaceuticals exploring rich biodiversity, availability of abundant traditional knowledge in this region and available expertise in the division. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Microbial Processes and Technology Division  :-</strong>The mandate of the Microbial processes and Technology Division (MPTD) division is to conduct high quality R & D in specific frontier areas of Biotechnology. The division is actively involved in research in the focussed areas for bioprocesses and products development byexploring and exploiting the microbial resources. The Division has a dedicated “Centre for Biofuels” for exclusive R&D on 2nd generation bioethanol. The pilot plant for the production of lignocellulosic bioethanol is now supported by on-site solid-state fermentation enzymes production pilot plant, bringing better cost-effective and handling opportunities.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Chemical Sciences and Technology Division  :-</strong> The vision of the division is to be internationally recognized for excellence in discovering new knowledge on functional materials and natural products/bioactive molecules and to develop such molecules/materials for industrial applications using innovative cost competitive and environmentally acceptable processing technologies. This division has the following sections: Photo sciences and Photonics, Inorganic and Polymeric Materials and Organic Chemistry. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Material Sciences and Technology Division  :-</strong> This division  is actively involved in cutting edge R&D activities leading to high science and relevant technologies in the areas of Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, Electronic and Magnetic materials. In addition, fundamental research of interdisciplinary nature is being carried out by the scientists of this division leading to high quality publications and patents. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Environmental Technology Division  :-</strong> he Environmental Technology Division is actively engaged in creating indigenous technologies for pollution control and value addition to the region’s natural resources.The entire activities of Environmental Technology Division (ETD) can be put under these two topics. Further, the divisional activities converge into the areas of waste management, dioxin research and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). From the expertise developed in waste management solutions, effluent treatment, soil remediation etc., the division has made a niche in state of the art technological solutions and mitigation measures.</li> <br>
