            Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums (IINRG) is a nodal Institute at national level for research and development on all aspects of lac and other natural gums & resins (excluding production) such as harvesting/ tapping, processing, product development, training, information repository, technology dissemination and national/international cooperation. The Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums (IINRG) was originally established as Indian Lac Research Institute (ILRI) for acting as a nodal agency for the research and development of lac and other natural resins and gums on 20 September 1924. The Institute was mandated to focus its attention on crop harvesting and tapping, produce processing, development of products, training, information repository, technology dissemination and liaison with other national and international agencies.</p>

        <h2>Mandate/Objective</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Research on lac production technologies and processing and value addition of natural resins (including lac), gums and gum-resins.</li>
            <li> Information dissemination, training and technology transfer to farmers, processors and entrepreneurs and tribal people on lac, gums and gum-resins for sustainable livelihood.</li>

        <h2>Research Work/Divisions/Inventions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lac Production Division  :-</strong> Lac is an important source of livelihood for farmers, especially in tribal areas. The Lac Production Division is a pioneer in lac production technologies. It is responsible for management of lac insects and their host plants for productivity and sustainability. The division maintains the largest live lac insects collection in the field gene bank. It is also the “National Lac Insect Germplasm Centre”. The institute research farm, spread over 36 hectares provides the experimental area for development and testing of lac production systems on different host plants. With technological interventions and support provided by the Institute, the farmers are able to achieve higher productivity on all major lac host trees.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Process and Product Development Division  :-</strong> The Process and Product development division was specifically created to undertake research on processing, value addition, product and by-product utilisation of natural resins and gums. The division primarily aims at entrepreneurship development. Over the years, this division has given many technologies to various industries. These technologies include - lac based surface coating compositions, adhesives and fine chemicals as well as machineries for processing of lac. </li> <br>
            <li><strong>Transfer of Technology Division  :-</strong>  For technologies to be relevant, they should reach the end users. The Transfer of Technology Division is engaged in this very activity of assessment, refinement and dissemination of institute technologies. The institute conducts regular interactions with farmers at field level for technological empowerment. The division also conducts structured and customised training programs for farmers, unemployed youth and officials from various government and non-government organisations which has contributed significantly to Human Resource Development in the Sector. The Lac Museum is a unique window showing the versatility of the product to raise general awareness of this economically important and versatile product. Samples of lac collected from all over the world are a special point of attraction of the museum.</li> <br>

        <h2>Research Achievments/Recognitions</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Institute has been designated as (NATLIGEC). Descriptors of lac insect <strong>National Lac Insect Germplasm Center </strong> have been developed and published. 65 lines of lac insects are being conserved live under potted conditions.</li> <br>
            <li>Production of kusmi lac insect breeds identified for ber and semialata. Five kusmi productive breeds of lac insects were multiplied and are being conserved under RFS.</li><br>
            <li>Mulching was found most effective in early establishment of ber and enhanced winter lac production under rainfed condition. It resulted in enhanced retention of soil moisture level (26% higher over control), during the post-monsoon period.
