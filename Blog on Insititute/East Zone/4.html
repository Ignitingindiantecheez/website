    <p>Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, formerly Rajendra Agricultural University, is a public
      central agriculture university and is recognised as Institute of National Importance by government of India. It is
      located in Pusa, Bihar. Rajendra Agricultural University was established as India's first-ever Imperial
      Agriculture Research Institute.
      In 1934, after a major earthquake rocked Bihar and which severely damage the main buildings, the Imperial
      Institute was shifted to the new Pusa campus in New Delhi and that eventually became Indian Agricultural Research
      Institute. What remained was downgraded to an agricultural research station until 3 December 1970, when the
      government of Bihar established Rajendra Agricultural University.
      On 11 May 2016, Parliament of India passed the Central University Bill. RAU has been upgraded to Central
      University and named as Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University.
