        <p>CSIR-Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology (IMMT) was established in 1964 as Regional Research
            Laboratory, Bhubaneswar. It was renamed in 2007 with a renewed research focus and growth strategy to be a
            leader in the areas of mineral & material resource engineering. The institute has expertise in conducting
            basic research and technology oriented programs in a wide range of subjects to address the R&D problems of
            mining, mineral and metals industries and ensure their sustainable development. For the last one decade, the
            main thrust of R&D at CSIR-IMMT has been to empower Indian industries to meet the challenges of
            globalization by providing advanced and zero waste process know-how and consultancy services for commercial
            exploitation of natural resources through the public-private-partnership (PPP) approach. Today, CSIR-IMMT is
            the first choice for many mineral based industries. It is also carving out a niche in processing of advanced
            materials for greater value addition and working on resource use efficiency of critical raw materials.

        <h2>Research Areas</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Advanced Materials Technology :-</strong> The scope of the AMT Dept includes development of suitable processes for production of industrial and strategic materials using plasma technology and carrying out exploratory research in advanced materials areas. The department has developed a number of plasma processes for smelting, melting and synthesis of carbides, oxides and successfully prepared different metals, ferroalloys and composites. Various processes use ore and minerals, industrial and agricultural wastes, e-wastes, etc. to develop bench scale technology. Significant work have been carried out and pursued in areas of nanomaterials, thin films and green steel.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Central Characterization :-</strong> The Department (Central Characterization) coordinates the utilization of sophisticated instruments for rendering analytical and testing services.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Materials Chemistry :-</strong> The mission of this department is to perform high quality basic and technology oriented research in the frontier areas of colloids and functional materials. This department has brought scientist together with different background (ranging from physics, chemistry to metallurgy) to carry out cutting-edge inter-disciplinary research to target the underpinning problems in the area of colloids, bio-materials, energy materials, hierarchical nanostructures, polymers, functional-inorganic materials, hybrid materials and coatings.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Design & Project Engineering :-</strong> The department developes technologies and associated products for rural industrialization and to improve quality of life in rural sector. Several lowcost technologies have been developed, propagated and commercialized by the department.
            The vision of the department is to develop various need based technologies to reduce cost of energy, and pollution and to increase productivity in industrial sector in rural India.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Environment & Sustainability :-</strong> The Department is engaged in Monitoring and abatement of environmental pollution in the vicinity of industries, mines, ports, ocean and other urban & rural areas as well as basic and applied research for utilization of bio-resources.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Hydro & ElectroMetallurgy :-</strong> The department is engaged in developing environmental and eco-friendly technologies to exploit various primary and secondary resources employing hydro and electro-metallurgy roots. It has having expertise for preparation of pre-feasibility reports, basic engineering process packages based on the flow sheet developed and is highly equipped with all modern and sophisticated infrastructural facilities to undertake the projects on turn key basis.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Mineral Processing :-</strong> The mineral beneficiation activities at IMMT, Bhubaneswar have been a part of the Minerals and Metals division since the inception of the laboratory in 1964. Following the significant changes in the scenario of mineral production and utilization in the country as a consequence of the new policy of liberalization and globalization, the recently reorganized Mineral Processing Department (formerly Mineral Processing Technology Department) re-oriented itself towards solving the R&D problems related to utilization of lean and off grade ores. The other thrust areas are energy and environmental aspects of processing different ores / minerals and development of processes for recovery of values from wastes and by products of mineral industries.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Process Engineering & Instrumentation :-</strong> The scope of Process Modeling & Instrumentation
                department is to provide support to various projects for process instrumentation, measurement, data
                acquisition & control. It is also provide process engineering and modeling back up to projects for
                developing laboratory scale prototypes, to take up innovative designs and developmental work on new
                processes and products based on basic R&D carried out at the laboratory and also to provide support in
                calibration of measuring instruments.</li> <br>
